Under the frequentist framework, asymptopia is needed for the estimator to be an efficient one. Asymptopia means that the 
estimator monotonically converges to one value as the size of data approaches infinity, so that identifying the parameter
that we are interested in uncovering. Let me give an example here. A typical regularity that applies the asymptotic theory
is the law of large numbers which states that  that for a sequence of independently and identically distributed (aka i.i.d.)
random variables X1, X2, \hdots, the sample averages \scriptstyle\overline{X}_n converge in probability to the population
